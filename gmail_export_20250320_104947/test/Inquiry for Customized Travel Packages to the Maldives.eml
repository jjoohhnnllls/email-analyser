   Dear TravelPulse Team,

   I hope this message finds you well and that your new office space is serving its purpose in fostering creativity and productivity.

   I am writing on behalf of the Smith family, who are planning a memorable vacation in the near future. We have been impressed by the wide array of travel packages you offer, particularly those focusing on exotic destinations such as the Maldives.

   The Smith family consists of four members: John (age 50), Mary (48), and their two children, Emily (16) and Sam (13). John is a keen scuba diver, while Mary prefers snorkeling and spa treatments. The children are enthusiastic about marine life and would enjoy interacting with sea turtles.

   We are seeking a customized travel package that includes:
   1. Scuba diving sessions for John, guided by an experienced instructor.
   2. Snorkeling trips for Mary, focusing on coral reefs and underwater wildlife.
   3. Educational marine life encounters for Emily and Sam, such as a visit to a sea turtle conservation center.
   4. Relaxing spa treatments for both parents at a luxurious resort.
   5. Family-friendly activities like island hopping and sunset cruises.

   We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with a detailed itinerary, along with competitive pricing and any available discounts for booking through your agency. Please let us know the earliest possible date for this trip, considering that we aim to travel within the next six months.

   Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to our request. We look forward to planning an unforgettable vacation with TravelPulse.

   Best regards,
   Jane Doe
